# Tutorhub
This is a demo of a tutor searching and matching application developed for the Johns Hopkins University's "Object Oriented Software Engineering" course. Visit the [deployment](https://tutorhub-public-demo.vercel.app/) to see it in action.

The [version of the application for the course](https://github.com/Matth-ewe-f/tutorhub-public/commit/53f7f8ff59a71646c0ae693d0b876c2851340cbf) was developed by a [team](#contributors) of 6 students, and that version of the app has since been bug-fixed and improved upon by Matthew Flynn.

## Description
Tutorhub is a online solution for finding both the best tutors for your difficult courses, and picking up new skills and hobbies. Users can create posts to offer tutoring in specific courses (linked to the Johns Hopkins course catalog), or in "activities," which can be anything from sports or music lessons to professional development. 

Users can browse posts created by other users, searching by course name or number, and filtering by various critera to find exactly what they're looking for. Tutors can also see analytics on their profiles, giving insight into who's interested in their tutoring sessions and how to market themselves better.

For demo purposes, anyone can log in as a guest, where they'll be allowed to search for tutoring posts and other users, but not create posts or leave reviews. To access the full functionality of Tutorhub, simply create a username (requires no personal information).
